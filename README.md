Project Brief
=============

I wish to collaborate my Mashup API class project with this project to create a real time, interactive air quality map service website. I will be using a map API, D3.js and an air quality API. Unfortunately the air quality API I want to use doesn't offer real time access to their jSON data via a URL but only exports a jSON file. Therefore, in this class I wish to grab their json file, load it in my own database, and set up my own app with a server to create a stand-alone application plus API.
